## About  

Crazy Chess is a chess variant designed for competitive play with unique character abilities.  
Players choose unique characters, each with distinct skills, and make **premove** actions to gain an advantage. Points earned can be used to activate special abilities

The project is still in its early stages, and development will progress over time.  
For more details on the game design, check out the [Planning Document](https://github.com/not-blond-beard/crazy-chess/wiki/Planning).  

## Business Model  

Crazy Chess will be fully **open-source**, but to sustain server costs, a **business model** is necessary.  
Currently, in-game ads are planned as the primary revenue source.  

## Contributions  

Contributions are always welcome! Even small contributions can make a big difference, and contributors will receive **in-game benefits** as a token of appreciation.  
Refer to the [CONTRIBUTING](./CONTRIBUTING.md) guide and join us in creating a fun, competitive game!
