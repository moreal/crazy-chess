# Contributing to Crazy Chess  

Thank you for your interest in contributing to **Crazy Chess**!  

## Project Status  

Development has not yet started.  
Currently, I plan to develop everything in **Rust**, using [Tonic](https://github.com/hyperium/tonic) for the backend and [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org/) for the client.  

Before implementing the custom chess mechanics, the first goal is to build a basic chess game with a minimal structure.  

## Contribution Timeline  

While this repository is public, it is not yet ready for contributions, as there is currently very little code.  
Once the fundamental chess game is functional, contributions will be open, and this document will be updated accordingly.  

Stay tuned, and thank you for your patience!
